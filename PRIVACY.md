This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the "Summary You" app unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
To provide you with the functionality of generating video summaries and article summaries, the "Summary You" app may need to send the text content of the respective media (videos and articles) to the servers of OpenAI. However, please be assured that we do not store any personal data from this process. We solely use this data for generating summaries and do not share it with any third parties.

The "Summary You" app may collect data and information for the purpose of improving the service and identifying and fixing errors. This may include technical information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, configuration of the app when using the Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. However, we do not collect personally identifiable information.

## Cookies
The "Summary You" app does not use cookies explicitly. We do not use cookies to collect information or improve our services.

## Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies or individuals to facilitate and improve our Service or to assist in analyzing how the Service is used. These third parties have access to the text content of the media you provide for the purpose of generating summaries. They are obligated not to disclose or use this information for any other purpose.

## Security
We take commercially acceptable measures to protect the data you provide for generating summaries. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
